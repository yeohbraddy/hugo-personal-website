title: Interactive Virtual 2D World for Universities and Other Communities
subtitle: " Virtual event and meeting applications has been a convenient and
  flexible alternative to doing so physically. However, although many of these
  current applications achieve their intended functionality and purpose, looks
  bland and are limited in their capabilities to create a more creative
  environment. To induce environments conducive to fun and creativity, this
  article proposes an application with event and meeting functionality
  supplemented by an interactive 2D world for universities and other
  communities."
