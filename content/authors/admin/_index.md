Hi, nice to meet you!

I have a huge passion for food and cooking, and I love travelling to learn about food and culture!

I also love fitness so I spend a lot of time lifting, sports, and mindfulness practices!

Learning and being productive are a few of my core values so I spend a lot of time reading, listening to various podcasts and talks, taking courses, coaching / mentoring, etc.

Moreover, I love music, particularly singing and playing the guitar.

As well, I a fan of emotional intelligence so I digest content about it and participate in coaching sessions.

Other than that I play games, watch movies, or chill with friends!
